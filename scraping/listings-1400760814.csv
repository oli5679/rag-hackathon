There is an original fireplace, a double bed with room underneath for storage, plenty of shelving, a small wardrobe and a clothes rail  and a little desk by the window that overlooks our garden. This is for just one person, not a couple, owing to pressure on the bathroom and kitchen.The room is in a terraced house just off Church Street. I own the house and live here with my 19-year-old daughter and our dog. Sorry, we can’t take any other pets – he is quite enough for us to manage! As we are an all-female household we feel more comfy with another female. We’ve shared our house with many lodgers over the years. We find that those who fit best often have busy lives of their own, as we do but we enjoy a chat in the kitchen as we come and go. I’m an ad creative and my daughter is currently on a gap year.There’s a kitchen with a dishwasher, a downstairs loo and an upstairs bathroom with a bath with a shower. There’s also a utility room. No tumble dryer.It’s a great location, just off Church Street but near the High Street. We are very close to Abney Park and Clissold Park is just a wander away past all the shops and cafes of Church Street. A little further is the famous Castle Climbing Centre and open water swimming reservoir. The leisure centre is nearby for indoor swimming, gym etc. There’s the Farmers Market at the weekend in the High Street. Transport links include buses on Church Street (73 heading for Angel and central London, the 393 to Highbury) buses on the High Street,(149 up to Seven Sisters tube or down to Dalston), Stoke Newington station is near.The rent is £750, paid by direct debit. . The deposit is one month’s rent, paid in advance. The bills are £140 a month which include utility bills, broadband, council tax, ( band E) TV licence, water. However, if the monthly usage on the utility bills increases then there will be additional charges. We don’t usually put the heating on during the working weekday. We all clean the house.A reference from an employer is required. We have had many people sharing our house with us over the years and especially love those from other countries. We find that people who have busy independent lives tend to fit best in the house. Sorry, there isn’t storage space outside your room other than a few pots and pans in the kitchen. There are bike storage units in the street which you can rent from the council.Drop me a message if you think you might like living here and fit in well, we really enjoy meeting people from other countries and people with interesting hobbies.",No,,Furnished,No,No,Females preferred,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426042.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426004.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426005.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426087.jpg""]",,English,,No,Stoke Newington,,36 months,,6 months,British,,2,Available to all,,No,No,N16Area,House share,Yes,£750 pcm,double,,,No,No,Stoke Newington Station,5-10 minutes by bus away,3,,

This first-floor one bedroom flat is perfect for one person or a couple. It's located in the calm and beautiful Highgate area and very close to the Highgate tube station, which makes it very convenient for commuting to central London (Northern Line).The flat is recently refurbished and equipped with reliable and modern appliances (incl. dishwasher, washing machine + drying machine). The living room /kitchen in particular has a cozy vibe with large double glazed windows and low windowsills.The living room is on the busy Archway Road, but the double glazed windows (only a few years old) make the traffic sound very mild so we have been able to work from this room without any issues. The bedroom, on the other hand, faces the other side so makes great sleeping conditions as the back side of the row of houses is only gardens so very quiet. The bedroom has an inbuilt wardrobe, with an option to add your own wardrobe in the bedroom, and an en-suite bathroom (smaller but modern).A lot of amenities are within walking distance in the area.Highgate Wood is only a 5 minute walk, and Waterlow Park is about 14 minutes away. Highgate Village with the local high street is a 10 minute walk.There is a bike shed outside in the rear of the building.Please let us know if you would like to arrange a viewing, and if you are interested we can then connect you with the landlord agency (Akelius) who would then take the process forward.The start date is only approximate, open to agreement between you, us and landlord.Council tax band is B.",No,,Part Furnished,No,No,,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423251.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423252.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423253.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423254.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423255.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423256.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423286.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423462.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423463.jpg""]",,,,own,Highgate,,None,,None,,,,Available to all,,No,No,N6Area,"Flat

With the window open for circulation, food smells don’t linger.Great size sink, built-in washing machineMini fridge with tiny freezer (there is under counter space for second freezer unit if needed).Microwave not provided but can be considered if needed. A lot of people bring their own appliances, and then I've got nowhere to store unwanted items from the lodger room.Electric kettle and basic crockery provided, one small pot and streamer pot provided.

I’m flexible on when you leave, except notice period cannot run during December and August please, July may be ok, more below.The £125 re-advertising fee applies to stays of 12 months or less and is fully refunded if you stay 13 months or more.---NOTICE PERIODOne full CALENDAR month’s notice is required i. e. You give notice latest at end of one month then the notice period runs from the 1st to the 31st of the following month.I ask notice period is not to run during the following months due to busy school holidays and potential travel plans thus my unavailability to arrange viewings to replace you: December, July & August.Your understanding and planning to avoid these months is greatly appreciated, and this will be part of the lodger agreement.NOTESA short-term lodger may potentially stay in our adjacent bedroom on occasion — this has never happened before and likely won’t; mentioned for transparency — it would have no impact on your privacy in the self contained lodger room.3 BASIC HOUSE RULES1- Please remove outside shoes either just outside the front door or as you enter to help keep the hall clean.2-Close the front door gently — a soft click is enough; no need to slam or push hard.3- There's no curfew — come and go as you please. Just kindly keep noise to a minimum at all times.Partial Council Tax Band D included.Any questions welcome, feel free to message me.",No,,Furnished,No,No,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067055.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067050.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067054.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067305.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067296.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067311.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067053.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/57/91577163.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/57/91577167.jpg""]",skiing,English,,No,East Finchley,60,1 month,20,1 month,,1,,Available to all,,No,No,N2Area,Flat share,Yes,"£1,150 pcm",double En suite,,,No,No,East Finchley Station,5-10 minutes walk away,2,,

Both rooms have under bed storage and we can add more shelves if needed. The price includes all bills and free parking. We also have cats, so you must be an animal lover!HouseThere is a communal living room with a real wood-burning fireplace. Patio doors lead to a generous garden with a brick barbecue, a pond with koi and goldfish, a tree-hung hanging chair, and additional seating at the back. It’s a real suntrap that backs onto a park. There is also a covered patio with a dining table, making it a great spot to sit all year round.The kitchen features an industrial-style fridge and freezer, so there's plenty of space for your food. It also includes a super-silent, fast washing machine. The kitchen is a great space to cook in and includes a hatch through to the living room.The bathroom is shared and features both a double shower and a double bath.Free parking is available outside the house, and there is a side covered entrance for securely locking up bikes.The house has fast wireless broadband, Sky, and access to all major streaming services for those cosy nights, films and series.AreaThere are lots of local shops nearby, including a butcher and a 24-hour convenience store and massive pub, plus a lovely park directly behind the house. There’s also an Aldi and a Sainsbury’s Local nearby, and a Morrisons and large shopping centre in Wood Green.Bruce Grove station has just a roller disco, and there are two affordable multiplex cinemas in Wood Green. I also use the outdoor heated swimming pool in Crouch End, which isn’t far.In terms of transport, Turnpike Lane and Wood Green (Piccadilly Line) are close by. Slightly further are Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale (Victoria Line) it takes me 20 mins to Kings Cross door to door but the nearest station is Bruce Grove Overground about a ten min walk which is just one stop from Seven Sisters and only 20 minutes to Liverpool Street on the overground. Buses at the top of the road go directly to all four stations, so you don’t have to walk if you’re not in the mood.YouSomeone with a professional job, but we will also consider students too. Ideally, you’ll work or study on-site, as one of us already works from home—but we’re also happy to consider a hybrid setup if it’s only a couple of days a week. The  big room does includes a fold-away table.Smoking and vaping are fine—but only in the garden, not in the house.UsYou’ll be sharing with a photographer originally from Cornwall and a teacher originally from Sunderland. We’re easygoing, got a great sense of humour, active, and love gardening, art, music, travel, woodworking —and, of course, photography. This isn’t a party house, but we enjoy the occasional drink and chat after work, while still respecting each other’s space. There’s plenty of room in the house and garden for alone time. Mainly looking for a good fit.And yes—you must love cats, because there is a few.Bobby",,,Furnished,,Yes,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/95/92/95923268.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98332894.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98332893.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/32/98323321.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/95/77/95779828.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/95/84/95841367.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98338125.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/95/77/95779839.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/95/92/95929909.jpg""]","music, travelling, cooking, gym, art, films, running, yoga, fitness, dancing, swimming, fashion, gardening, outdoors, interior design",English,Yes,shared,London N17,60,None,22,2 months,English,,2,Available to all,,Yes,No,N17Area,House share,,£850 pcm,double,,,No,No,,,3,,

I have been a landlord for over thirty years and it is my full time occupation so I can respond quickly to your needs.Upon payment, your deposit is immediately protected by the Government Scheme, MyDeposits. You will be issued with a signed certificate which will give you peace of mind. If I run off to South America with some pretty girl (unlikely but I can dream!) or get run over by a bus (hopefully not but more likely as I cycle everywhere), you will be able to get your deposit back. I always return deposits quickly and efficiently in full as soon as the keys are returned. All you need to do is give me one month’s notice and clean your room on departure.Do get in touch if you require more information or would like to arrange a visit. I look forward to hearing from you.Charles",No,,Furnished,No,No,3 Males,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/80/84/80845927.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/80/84/80845928.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/80/84/80845930.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/80/84/80845931.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/31/79/3179322.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/31/79/3179324.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/31/79/3179321.jpg""]",,,,No,Hoxton,,None,,1 month,,,3,Available to all,,No,No,N1Area,House share,No,"£1,090 pcm",single,,,No,No,Old Street Station,5-10 minutes walk away,4,,

The rooms are available from 17th December 2025 and 2nd January 2026.The  property  is  located  in  a  residential  street.  All  the  shops  are  practically  on  your  door  step:  24  hour  Sainsbury's,  Iceland,  Tesco  and  many  local  groceries.  Most  Turkish  shops  are  open  24  hours.  You'll  be  surrounded  by  lots  of  nice  restaurants,  bars  and  cafes.  Honestly,  you  can  never  starve  in  this  area  :)  Finsbury  Park  with  a  free  outdoor  gym  is  only  a  5  min  walk.  It's  lovely  to  go  for  a  run  in  the  morning. There are several local gyms in the area. Wood  Green  shopping  centre  is  just  10  min  by  bus  or  a  smaller  shopping  centre  in  Harringey  Arena  is  a  2  min  walk.Extremely  good  transport  connections  to  Central  London.  The  tube  station  is  only  7 - 10 min  walk  and  there  are  lots  of  buses  available:  29,  141,  341,  253,  254,  279.  (Victoria  and  Piccadilly  lines  run  a  24  hour  service  on  Fri  and  Sat).  There  are  night  buses  also:  29,  341, 259  and  253.There  are 2 males and 1 female living  in  the  house  at  the  moment,  all  working  professionals.  We  are  from Ukraine and Albania.  We  are  friendly and respectfu flatmatesl,  looking  for  somebody  similar  who  is  clean  and  tidy.The  atmosphere  in  the  house  is  very  important  to  us.  We  are  looking  for  somebody  who  is  considerate  and  respects  other  people,  their  privacy  and  gets  on  well  with  others, who  CLEANS  after  her/himself, does not spend entire day/evening on a loudspeaker, does not make noise and does not slam the doors.  There  are  certain  rules  in  the  house  like  no  smoking  (if  you  smoke,  you  can  only  do  so  outside  -  this  is  very  strict).  We  also  have  a  cleaning  rota,  that we all respect, and  cleaning  products  collection  once  every  3  months  -  it's  approximately  £1 per month.The  house  is  quite  spacious and there are days you probably won't see anyone.  There  is  a  kitchen  and  a  separate  living  room  with  a  sofa,  armchair,  dining  table,  etc.  The  kitchen  is  large  with  many  cupboards  - you  will  have  enough  space  for  your  stuff.  We have  2  fridges and a fairly new  combi  boiler.  The  heating  works  well and so does  hot  water.  All  windows  are  double  glazed (some were replaced in December 2023).We  have  2  bathrooms:  1  with  a  bath  tub,  another  one  with  just  a  shower  (not  using  it  really  as  the  main  bathroom  is  nicer)  and  a  separate  WC  on  the  ground  floor. There  is  a  small  private  rear  garden which is great to use in summer and is very useful for drying the laundry.The larger room is on the ground floor. It has a bay window and gets lots of light. It is furnished with a new double bed, a wardrobe, 2 chest of drawers, a desk and a table, a sideboard, a shelving unit and a mirror. The curtains are proper blackout curtains.The second room is also on the ground floor and has a garden view (side). It comes with a double bed, a wardrobe, a  desk, a  chair, a shelving unit and a mirror. A new chest of drawers can be provided (the current flatmate brought her own).The rent is £780pm and £880pm inclusive of bills.  Please note that the gas and electricity are included up to the maximum of £85pm per person. In the unlikely event of exceeding this amount in winter (which has not happened yet), we will need to contribute/split the amount above £85pm. Also, if you watch TV or watch TV programmes on your phone/laptop, you will need to get your own TV licence.1  month  deposit  which  goes  towards  your  last  month's  rent  (so  it's  not  a  deposit  but  your  last  month's  rent)  plus  1  month's  rent  are required  to  move  in.The  minimum  stay  is  3  months.  Short  let  can  also  be  considered at a slightly higher rate.  When  you  decide  to  move  out  you  will  need  to  give  a  1  month's  notice the day before your rent is due.  To  reserve  the  room  £100  holding  deposit  will  be  required  (you  will  get  a  receipt).  The  rest  will  be  paid  on  the  moving  in  day  (minus  £100).  Professional  people  and  students  preferably,  please.Please note that there is a restaurant next door, which means that you might hear the staff disposing of rubbish in the bins - could be late at night - for a few seconds - as well as some early morning food deliveries - around 7 am.Please  email  me  if  you  have  any  questions  or  if  you  would  like  to  arrange  a  viewing.For  a  fast  response text, Whatsapp  or  Viber  messages  would  be  best.

Great bus services into central London.**This is a Homeshare opportunity**COST ** £199 per month plus £100 for bills**** Available immediately for the right person subject to our matching and vetting process**We are delighted to offer a lovely new Homeshare opportunity available immediately subject to our vetting process, for a sharer to live comfortably and affordably in an excellent location in North London, in return for some providing some practical support and companionship and an overnight reassuring presence to an older lady in her early 80s.What the Opportunity involves:In return for the low-cost accommodation (£199 per month), we are looking to match our older homeowner with a kind, cheerful and tidy sharer who can provide some friendly companionship, a little practical support around the house, and a reassuring overnight presence.Our homeowner, who is in her early 80s, is a bright, interesting, kind and friendly lady. An academic who is still working in research and writing. Her interests include following current affairs, particularly social and community issues, politics and music (she plays classical guitar daily and listens to Classic FM), languages (she speaks Spanish and French). She likes to read The Economist and listen to BBC Radio 4 and go for a daily walk. She has some mobility difficulties following an accident and she uses a wheeled walker when walking outside.She is in regular close contact with her children and grandchildren and she meets up with friends every week.She is mostly vegetarian and cooks herself a simple meal in the evenings. She is however open to sharing with a non-vegetarian. She has her food delivered weekly and there is not much in terms of space in the kitchen and fridge for storage so this opportunity will not suit somebody who comes with a lot of equipment and groceries or who likes to batch cook, but rather someone who is happy to make or heat up something fresh daily.Our homeowner is looking to share her home with a compatible, interesting younger person (most probably in their 20s, 30s or 40’s) who is working or perhaps doing a PhD. Our homeowner would prefer to share with a female.Practical help might include putting shopping away, emptying the bins, light housework such as tasks that the homeowner finds difficult, watering the plants, helping with IT, local errands if needed, locking up at night.She would be delighted to share a few meals and some company and conversation some evenings or maybe watch a good documentary or home/garden /nature programme and possibly go on some local walks together. An overnight reassuring presence is essential so we are looking for somebody who would expect to stay in the home most nights and would not have too many travel commitments.The ideal sharer will be kind and companionable, happy, clean and tidy, flexible and helpful. Someone mostly working out of the home during the day or on a hybrid basis and who enjoys a quieter, calm lifestyle. A non-smoker.We are looking to match this Homeshare opportunity soon. If it is of interest, please message us telling us about yourself, your work/study situation, and interests, and particularly why you consider that you would be well suited to this Homeshare. Thank you.COST ** £199 per month**This is a monthly facilitation fee for our matching and ongoing monitoring service. You do NOT pay any rent to the Homeowner. Bills £100 per month.We are a social enterprise facilitating Homeshare matches across London and surrounding areas. We match people who live alone and need some practical support and company, with mature adults wanting affordable accommodation who are happy to provide some companionship and practical support in return for a safe place to live.

I'm Theo - A Londoner of 5+ years looking to find a flatmate to fill a vacant room in my lovely flat in Archway/Highgate :)I recently moved into this two-bedroom flat in Northwood Hall, an amazing historical art deco building halfway between Archway and Highgate. Truly the nicest flat I've had in five years of living in London.Read on for more details, but TL; DR the spare bedroom is small but the rest of the flat is perfection :)The flat/your room:- Available immediately. Ideally would like to find someone for the long term, but open to short-term lets (try out the place for a month and stay for longer if you're happy here!)- Small room with a double bed (see floorplan)- Furnished flat. The room has a double bed and wardrobe- £1000/month, including gas/heating/hot water (saves roughly £100/month)- Council tax band C- Perfect location IMO, no compromises. Equidistant to Archway, Highgate, Crouch End. 10 min walk to either Archway or Highgate tube.

I’m looking for someone to take over my room from January through the beginning of June, with the possibility of staying longer. Some family matters have come up, and I’ll be moving in with my partner during that time, so I’m hoping to find someone who’ll enjoy the home as much as I have.The flat is in a brilliant part of Highbury, just a short walk from Canonbury Station and the leafy calm of Clissold Park. It’s one of those neighbourhoods that gives you both convenience and a sense of quiet, which has made living here feel grounding.The bedroom is genuinely spacious, with enough room for a king sized bed, dressers, and shelving. Most of the furniture can be purchased at a fair price if that helps make your move smoother.Shared spaces include a well sized bathroom and a generous kitchen equipped with a laundry machine and dishwasher. It’s a relaxed, comfortable place to live.Rent is £1550 a month, with utilities and council tax adding roughly £150 each. House rules are simple. Respect shared spaces, no indoor smoking, and a quick heads-up for out-of-town guests. Partners are welcome a few times a week. The flat has always had a friendly, easy vibe and it would be great to keep that same energy.Your future flatmate is easygoing, clean, and works full time. There’s a healthy balance of social time and personal space in the home, which has made it a great environment to come back to each day.We’ll arrange the usual referencing checks with the estate agent so everything is handled properly for taking over the lease. And again, while the initial commitment is January to early June, there’s potential to stay on longer depending on how things unfold.If you’re looking for a warm, welcoming home in a fantastic neighbourhood, feel free to reach out.

I'm looking to sublet a lovely room in a 2 bed 2 bath flat share in Angel as my flatmate is moving out to move in with her partner, and I love the flat and the area and keen to stay. The room is available from 1st February. The contract runs until 30 Nov 2026 - with option to extend with our landlord beyond.I'm looking for a single person rather than a couple, and someone who wants to live in a really lovely and well maintained flat, and keep a very friendly and considerate atmosphere, and look after it!The room / flatIt's a furnished and spacious double room with lots of storage space and its own separate private bathroom (down the hall) in a really well maintained and looked after modern flat. We have a really spacious sitting room & dining room with floor to ceiling windows/French door, and a separate kitchen with modern appliances. The flat is located on the 5th floor and has great views of the city. There are only 2 flats per floor, and 6 floors in total, with a communal garden area, so it has a nice, secure feel to it and everyone in the building is always friendly.The monthly payment to the landlord is £1,229 each (£1,198 rent + £31 broadband), and monthly bills come to around £175 each on top of this (breakdown below). All in all this means total monthly rent and bills come to ~£1,403.- Rent + broadband pp £1,229- Council tax pp £103- Energy bill pp £47- Water bill pp £26Current flatmateI am Dominika and have lived in the flat for 5 years (in London for >10) and know the area really well. I am friendly and very active - play basketball a couple of times a week in a local league, cycle and run around the local area, enjoy walks around London, eating out, and travel - often jetting around on holidays, visiting family in Poland or friends abroad. I work as a management consultant and am generally in the office but will also work from home a couple of times a week. Both bedrooms have space for desks and so my flatmate and I both tend to work from our rooms.Who I am looking forI am ideally looking for a female professional aged 28+ who's lived in flatshares before, is respectful and friendly. I am not looking for couples or long term partners low-key moving in. Would like to keep a very friendly atmosphere in the flat, and someone who is looking for the same. The flat isn't a party house, but on occasion we can fit ~6-8 people around the table for a dinner party.The areaThe areas is fantastic. Upper Street and Angel are on your doorstep, as is Regent's Canal and Dalston / Hackney / Shoreditch, and you are also so close to the city. The flat is located on a quiet road and only a 5 minute walk from Essex Road station. The neighbourhood has so much going on - we're really close to some lovely spots, some of our favourites are the bakeries Pophams and Quince, Devotion for coffee and the Earl of Essex and Duke of Cambridge pub. Upper Street is also a short walk away (10 mins), as well as Angel Station and Highbury & Islington (10-15 min walk) where there are so many more shops, restaurants, cafes and amenities.Transport linksEssex Road station is a 5 minute walk away (trains connect to Highbury & Islington and Moorgate), or it's a 10-15 minute walk to Angel Station (Northern Line) and Highbury & Islington (Victoria Line, Overground). If you cycle it's incredibly convenient and centrally located, e. g. 20 minutes to get into Soho/Central.

The house is situated in a very quiet residential area: Belmont with local parks and shops nearby.The room:A small single on the top floor of the house. It comes furnished with a small wardrobe, shelves, a big chest of drawers and a single bed. It has a sash window and lots of light. It faces a quiet road.At the moment, the room has a bunk bed, which creates more space, but there is the option to keep it or replace it with the single bed.The house:The house is a beautiful end-of-terrace home with many original period features which make it extra special. We have a big living room with three sofas and a wide-screen smart TV (Freeview, Firestick), a large kitchen (gas hob, electric oven, air fryer, fridge freezer, microwave, toaster, washing machine, dining table), a bathroom with shower, and a second toilet downstairs. We’re lucky to have a lovely garden (perfect if you’re into gardening!). We also have broadband (700Mb) and gas central heating.We’ve really made this house into our home so it would suite someone who is looking for a calm and comfortable environment. There’s a lovely atmosphere here – we respect each other’s space and belongings, and we all do our bit to keep the house clean and tidy at all times.The area:The street has a great community spirit and there’s a street party every year. It’s mostly settled families living here, so it’s peaceful and quiet. We’re a short walk from Turnpike Lane tube and there are loads of handy bus routes nearby – the 24-hour 243 takes you directly to Stoke Newington, Dalston, Old Street and on to Waterloo / South Bank. Within walking distance we have: Green Lanes (delicious Turkish food, independent shops and bars); Crouch End (nice cafes, restaurants, cinemas); Wood Green (large stores and supermarkets); and Alexandra Palace which is great for walking and has stunning views across London.The housemates:One female (Slovakia) and two males (UK/Colombia) in our 30s and 40s. One of us has lived in this house for 18 years (it really is that good!). We are employed as: a graphic designer/photographer; a financial administrator and a film editor.Our interests include cooking, gardening, music, film, football, yoga, meditation, music festivals. We all get on well and it’s very important to us that we maintain the lovely, respectful family atmosphere that we have here. Now and then we’ll get together for a movie, a barbecue in the garden or a Sunday roast – but we also appreciate time alone to do our own thing.We’re early risers so the house is quiet after 10pm on week-nights (and generally too, to be honest) so if you want somewhere to party and play loud music late at night then this isn’t the place for you.We’re looking for someone who will fit right in and is genuinely looking for the kind of home we have here. If this sounds like you then please get in touch!To apply for a viewing please tell us a bit about yourself and why you’d like to move in with us, and we’ll get back to you.Rent: £445 per monthBills: £166 per month (Council Tax, Gas, Electricity, Water, broadband, TV licence, household cleaning products, communal kitchen essentials)Deposit: £450The estate agent will require references to carry out a credit check: no feeTotal cost to secure room and move in: £1061",No,,Furnished,No,Yes,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/77/33/77336519.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/77/33/77336530.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/77/33/77336540.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/77/33/77336601.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/77/33/77336625.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98332543.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98332547.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/33/98332567.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/34/98342878.jpg""]","music, sports, films, yoga, photography, events",English,,shared,London N22,50,None,30,12 months,,,3,Not suitable for students,,Yes,No,N22Area,House share,Yes,£445 pcm,single,,,No,No,Turnpike Lane Station,5-10 minutes walk away,4,,

It's on the top floor so has plenty of light and very nice views of the local parks. It is less than 10 minutes walk from highgate tube station, and only 12 minutes on the tube to Euston station.The room has a large double bed, a desk/personal workspace, and plenty of storage with a built-in wardrobe. The flat is fully furnished, and the room come complete with new feather pillows and bedding, so if you have just arrived in London and don't have these kinds of furnishings, we have it all covered.I have just finished my PhD in anthropology at UCL, so I am often working from home and can be found at my desk in my own personal study space in my bedroom. While I do sometimes listen to music to keep myself focussed, the flat has particularly good soundproofing and you can't hear any music in the bedrooms.In the bathroom we have a great power-shower as well as a full-sized bathtub. We have a compact but practical kitchen with all essential amenities, including a washing machine and a dryer.Please note that this is a smoking household, and cigarettes are allowed to be smoked inside the house. This is an important point for us, so please ensure this isn't a problem for you. The flat is unlikely to be suitable for non-smokers who are sensitive to cigarette smoke, or people with asthma/lung problems.While we are a very work-driven household, we do occasionally enjoy a social evening or dinner sometimes at the weekend, which you are most welcome to join.The room is available from the 5th of December until the 5th of March 2026. Rent is £900 per month, including all bills and a cleaner - the price is for a single-person occupancy of an ample double room. We are willing to consider couples- though we would need to have a conversation first to ensure everyone is a good fit. For Couples: please note that rent would need to be adjusted to factor in costs of an extra person.If this all sounds good and you would like to come and have a look around, please get in touch and we can arrange a viewing at a time that is convenient for you. I am happy to schedule viewings at any time throughout the day or evening - so don't worry if you have unusual working hours, we can work around that and find a time that suits everyone.I look forward to hearing from you, and hope to meet our new flatmate soon.Best,Raffaella",Yes,,Furnished,Yes,Yes,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/40/91/40916491.jpg""]","travelling, art, films, anthropology",Mixed,,No,Highgate,,3 months,,1 month,,2,,Available to all,,Yes,No,N6Area,Flat share,No,£850 pcm,double,,,Yes,Yes,Highgate Station,5-10 minutes walk away,2,University College London (UCL) (Bloomsbury Campus),

The available room is the one with wooden floorboards. There are photos of the room above it to show an alternative layout.The room would best suit friendly, tidy and considerate person in their *30s*, who is happy to socialise and contribute re the house, and are also happy to do their own thing. If you think you're a good fit please get in touch with a bit about yourself and **how you think you would be a good fit for our home **, and when you're available to view. Messages that just ask to view will be ignored.*****We are looking for someone to sign a new tenancy with the two existing housemates so we're looking to find the right person, relatively quickly. You'll need to go through reference checks with the agency and all that jazz.*****Apologies but we can't have pets due to allergies.HOUSEMATESThe house is made up of three other friendly professionals who are like a mix of social chats, films, pub visits and also tend to do their own thing. Hobbies include comedy, cinema, crafts, photography, interior design, politics, gardening and all things related to plants!We'd love to find someone who will treat the house as a home, especially as it comes unfurnished and every now and again we need to replace shared items. You get bonus points if you're up for helping out in the garden as it grows quickly! We would also prefer people who work hybrid or in the office although it doesn't need to be a deal-breaker.You would be sharing with Sophie, 35 (me) who loves gardening and interior design, and works hybrid for a charity, and Alex, 39, who is a participation lead in a social enterprise. Elliot has just joined us and is keen to create a social vibe :)We have a living room with a TV, and a dining room, garden with a patio and lawn, two toilets and a bathroom. There are wooden floors throughout the ground floor. There isn't a lot of room for more furniture in the communal spaces. There is ample storage space including a basement, loft and space in the garden to keep your bike safe.We have a cleaning rota, so we're looking for someone prepared to do their bit once a month.RENT & BILLS* The rent/bills total for both rooms is currently £740 pcm ALL IN (inc. council tax, TV license and fibre broadband).**Deposit is £600 which you'll need to pay to secure the room. This is non-negotiable, if you don't pay the deposit when offered the room we will offer it to someone else.*** A £50 tenancy swap fee will be split equaly between the incoming and outcoming tenant.**** We'd like to find someone by 14 Dec but there is wiggle room. You will only pay rent from the day you take over the room so if you move in during that the middle of the period both you and the outgoing tenant will pay less than a full month's rent.ROOMThe room comes unfinished and is south-facing with high ceilings overlooking the garden. It has wooden floorboards and an ornamental fireplace.AREAHarringay is a great area with lots of shops, restaurants and bars and cafes within 5mins walk.
