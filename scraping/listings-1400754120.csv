Given the size of the flat you’ll have lots of privacy but also company if you want.

The space feels calm, bright and modern, with resin flooring and underfloor heating throughout.The living area is open plan, with a sliding wall that allows the bedroom to be either enclosed for privacy or opened up to create a spacious, loft-like environment with natural cross-ventilation.The kitchen is fitted with high-quality Bosch and AEG appliances.

The community is friendly and the estate includes a well-used residents’ hall. Off-street parking is available.The Alexandra & Ainsworth Estate was granted Grade II* status in 1993 and described by then Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke as “one of the most distinguished groups of buildings in England since the Second World War.”This apartment offers a rare balance of outdoor space, tranquillity and community spirit, set within internationally celebrated modernist architecture.

I have a room for rent in my renovated flat located just north of Kings Cross, off Camden Square in a secure, well looked after, small and friendly estate.As mentioned the flat has had a complete renovation, new kitchen with lovely oak work surfaces and new bathroom with shower and bath, all very stylish and contemporary. The front room and kitchen have been made open plan to make a large airy space, also new walnut wooden flooring has been installed, and the whole flat has had a full repaint.The room for rent measures 3.00m x 2.50m, it is furnished with a double bed and brand new mattress, a set of drawers and an in-built wardrobe.In terms of amenities, there is a washing machine, dishwasher and fiberoptic broadband and a fully equipped kitchen. I have also installed a home cinema as I'm am a massively in to film, which any potential flatmate will be welcome to use.In terms of transport, the flat is very centrally located and fantastically connected. Camden Town Tube (northern line) /Camden Overground are 10mins walk, as is Kings Cross.Caledonian Road Tube (Piccadilly Line) and Caledonian Road & Barnsbury Overground are also 10mins walk. The 390 and 274 buses run from directly outside the flat, less than a minutes walk, which gives easy access to the West End, Angel, Camden Town and Archway.Personally, I work as a professional portrait photographer, and am ideally looking for someone who has similar interests, or that works in the creative industries, although this is not a necessity. I am ideally looking only at professionals, but mature students will be considered.I spend time with friends in the evening, but also spend a fair amount of time at home chilling out, watching films, listening to music and occasionally having friends over. I love cooking and am more than happy to make the occasional meal. I would expect any potential flatmate to be respectful that its is my home and not party house and ideally treat it like their own home too!Cleaning is also split, but its wooden floors and doesn't  take much to keep clean, but getting a cleaner is always an option too.Get in contact if your interested, and we can organise a viewing!ThanksLuke",No,,Furnished,No,Yes,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/39/78/39780181.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/39/78/39780175.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/61/79/6179738.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/61/79/6179758.jpg""]","cooking, cycling, photography, exhibitions",English,,shared,Camden,50,None,20,6 months,English,1,,Available to all,,No,No,NW1Area,Flat share,Yes,"£1,000 pcm",double,,,No,No,,,2,,

The remaining tenants - Amy, Satori and Maxine - are late twenties and are searching for someone of similar age who is looking for a new home and flatmates to call friends.Amy is a project manager for an EdTech company, Satori is an Events Executive and Maxine is a Consultant. They are fantastic housemates, friendly and respectful of each other's space. We all liked to grab the occasional pint and catch up at the pub downstairs or pop out for a show/movie in the evening and are hoping for the new housemate to have a similar vibe.The flat is above a family-friendly pub that has regular pub quizzes and delicious roasts. The room on offer is a first floor double and comes furnished with a bed and storage and is near the kitchen (perfect for midnight snacks). The flat has two bathrooms and 2 fridge-freezers in the kitchen alongside a washing machine and separate dryer. The landlord is super responsive and fast to sort out any issues and is contactable directly (though an agency handles the contract).The flat is in a cute area with 2 bakeries in walking distance, charity shops and a small Tescos near Kensal Rise station. There is also a gym less than 5 minutes down the road and a large Sainsburys about a 15 minute walk away.

There's also a utility room with a washer & dryer machine.Current flatmates are: a graphic designer/composer/music producer, an actor/filmmaker, and a PT/influencer. Yeah it's all men, but it's not all lads lads lads. It's usually the news on the TV and we're interested in left-wing politics. No Andrew Tate fans should apply. Or anyone adament that children are being forced into being trans (ffs).The atmosphere is very chilled and relaxed, never any arguments, and really we don't want any drama brought to the house. Here are some examples of previous problems we've had which has resulted in people having a swift exit:-Move in, and then two weeks later announce they can't pay the rent-Be threatening and aggressive to the others after getting drunk on cheap lager every night-""Secretly"" move their girlfriend in (we will know...)Pretty obvious stuff really! We're all professionals who are too old for that kind of student lifestyle. Having said that we're a pretty social bunch, and go for house visits to pubs / restaurants / clubs / cinema / Barry's Bootcamp.We are on a main road, but we have double glazing throughout - and the room available has additional secondary glazing to further reduce noise so it's pretty quiet. We have a tado system on the heating so the temperature in the bedroom can be set. The kitchen is also our communal area with cinema-style motorised recliner seats and a 65"" TV, so it's pretty much a combined kitchen and living room. Also there's also an outside terrace, with a bench and barbecue.

Two convenience stores are located less than a minute’s walk away and are open daily until 11 pm.The residence is extremely safe and well-maintained, with CCTV throughout the building and secure entry. The flat is located on the 4th floor with two lifts available for easy access. Within the residence, there is also a co-working café open from 10 AM to 2 PM, serving coffee, hot drinks, and cakes, a perfect spot for working, studying, or enjoying a break.Occasionally, I may have family visiting on Friday or Saturday evenings, but never anything loud or disruptive (no parties, no chaos, just calm family time!)Disclaimer:The flat overlooks a train depot. The view is actually very photographic and unique, but please keep in mind that a depot is simply a parking area for trains — not an active platform. This means you won’t experience loud train noises, and the double-glazed windows ensure the flat stays quiet and peaceful. You will still enjoy a comfortable environment and a good night’s sleep.",,,Furnished,,,Females preferred,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268266.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268265.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268267.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268262.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268263.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98268264.jpg""]","travelling, art, dancing, netflix, going out",,,No,North Acton,,None,,2 months,,1,,Available to all,,,No,NW10Area,Flat share,,"£1,000 pcm",double,,,No,No,,,2,,
