18083988,66,,Yes,Now,No,No,No,No,£750.00,,,,,,,,"We have a lovely large room to rent with a view of our garden. It should be free from the second or third week in January. There is an original fireplace, a double bed with room underneath for storage, plenty of shelving, a small wardrobe and a clothes rail  and a little desk by the window that overlooks our garden. This is for just one person, not a couple, owing to pressure on the bathroom and kitchen.The room is in a terraced house just off Church Street. I own the house and live here with my 19-year-old daughter and our dog. Sorry, we can’t take any other pets – he is quite enough for us to manage! As we are an all-female household we feel more comfy with another female. We’ve shared our house with many lodgers over the years. We find that those who fit best often have busy lives of their own, as we do but we enjoy a chat in the kitchen as we come and go. I’m an ad creative and my daughter is currently on a gap year.There’s a kitchen with a dishwasher, a downstairs loo and an upstairs bathroom with a bath with a shower. There’s also a utility room. No tumble dryer.It’s a great location, just off Church Street but near the High Street. We are very close to Abney Park and Clissold Park is just a wander away past all the shops and cafes of Church Street. A little further is the famous Castle Climbing Centre and open water swimming reservoir. The leisure centre is nearby for indoor swimming, gym etc. There’s the Farmers Market at the weekend in the High Street. Transport links include buses on Church Street (73 heading for Angel and central London, the 393 to Highbury) buses on the High Street,(149 up to Seven Sisters tube or down to Dalston), Stoke Newington station is near.The rent is £750, paid by direct debit. . The deposit is one month’s rent, paid in advance. The bills are £140 a month which include utility bills, broadband, council tax, ( band E) TV licence, water. However, if the monthly usage on the utility bills increases then there will be additional charges. We don’t usually put the heating on during the working weekday. We all clean the house.A reference from an employer is required. We have had many people sharing our house with us over the years and especially love those from other countries. We find that people who have busy independent lives tend to fit best in the house. Sorry, there isn’t storage space outside your room other than a few pots and pans in the kitchen. There are bike storage units in the street which you can rent from the council.Drop me a message if you think you might like living here and fit in well, we really enjoy meeting people from other countries and people with interesting hobbies.",No,,Furnished,No,No,Females preferred,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426042.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426004.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426005.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98426087.jpg""]",,English,,No,Stoke Newington,,36 months,,6 months,British,,2,Available to all,,No,No,N16Area,House share,Yes,£750 pcm,double,,,No,No,Stoke Newington Station,5-10 minutes by bus away,3,,

As well as a spacious bedroom with lots of built-in storage, you also get your own lovely bathroom with bathtub and half of a separate shared office room which fits two desks (I’m flexible on which days I work from home so we could arrange things so that you have this completely to yourself 2-3 days a week). The flat also has a big, beautiful shared living/dining room and a lovely spacious kitchen with a dishwasher and Smeg appliances. My room is on a separate floor with its own en-suite so the flat feels very spacious and we both have a lot of privacy.We absolutely love the area! Hither Green station is less than 10 mins walk away with plenty of direct trains into central - 9 mins to London Bridge, 16 mins to Waterloo East, 20 mins to Charing Cross, 7 mins to New Cross. It’s 2 mins walk to a beautiful park, a Co-op, a well-connected bus stop, and a high street with cute cafes, restaurants and a lovely local bar. There are great pubs 10 mins away and you can hop into New Cross/Deptford on the bus in 20 mins.You’d be living with me, Ali, 32, non-binary trans. I’m a writer and also work as a creative consultant for non-profits. I’m very sociable but like my own space too, it’d be lovely to live with someone who becomes a friend but also has their own stuff going on. I want the flat to feel like a cosy, relaxing home so I keep things pretty clean and tidy. Bonus if you want to bring lots of books (plenty of built-in shelf space) and/or a cat (the landlords are fine with it!)We’re flexible on move-in date, can arrange things quickly if needed but also happy to wait a bit longer for the right person. You’ll need to pass referencing and affordability checks with the landlord. Bills come to around £160 each with the heating on but will go down in summer.

18083636,,,,20 Dec 2025,No,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hello fellow Londoners,We are looking for replacement tenants to take over our tenancy in this apartment as we are moving out soon after three years of living here. This first-floor one bedroom flat is perfect for one person or a couple. It's located in the calm and beautiful Highgate area and very close to the Highgate tube station, which makes it very convenient for commuting to central London (Northern Line).The flat is recently refurbished and equipped with reliable and modern appliances (incl. dishwasher, washing machine + drying machine). The living room /kitchen in particular has a cozy vibe with large double glazed windows and low windowsills.The living room is on the busy Archway Road, but the double glazed windows (only a few years old) make the traffic sound very mild so we have been able to work from this room without any issues. The bedroom, on the other hand, faces the other side so makes great sleeping conditions as the back side of the row of houses is only gardens so very quiet. The bedroom has an inbuilt wardrobe, with an option to add your own wardrobe in the bedroom, and an en-suite bathroom (smaller but modern).A lot of amenities are within walking distance in the area.Highgate Wood is only a 5 minute walk, and Waterlow Park is about 14 minutes away. Highgate Village with the local high street is a 10 minute walk.There is a bike shed outside in the rear of the building.Please let us know if you would like to arrange a viewing, and if you are interested we can then connect you with the landlord agency (Akelius) who would then take the process forward.The start date is only approximate, open to agreement between you, us and landlord.Council tax band is B.",No,,Part Furnished,No,No,,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423251.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423252.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423253.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423254.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423255.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423256.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423286.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423462.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/42/98423463.jpg""]",,,,own,Highgate,,None,,None,,,,Available to all,,No,No,N6Area,"Flat

I’ve lived here for 3 years but am moving in with my partner so unfortunately it’s time to go.As seen in the pictures, there are two windows - the large one is east-facing, the smaller, frosted one is south-facing - so you get a lot of light all year round.The room comes furnished with the following:Double bed and mattressStorage trunk (at end of bed)WardrobesChests of drawers (except pine one with mirror)Full length, free-standing mirrorNB: I may sell other furniture in the room so please do ask if you’re interested. Additionally, our landlord is fairly relaxed about removing furniture so this can be negotiated.THE HOUSEIt’s a three-storey, semi-detached townhouse in a private, gated mews. There are 5 other houses assembled around a courtyard. There is a (unoccupied) carport for our house if you need somewhere to park, visitor parking is available for guests, and there are several bike racks.The ground floor opens on to a hallway with a small bathroom (toilet), the kitchen, and a storage area under the stairs.On the first floor is the advertised room, one other bedroom (Amelia’s), and a bathroom. The bathroom is shared only by you and Amelia, and features a bath and shower, as well as built-in storage and another small cupboard under the sink.On the second floor lives a couple, Monique and Felix, with their room and bathroom on a self-contained floor.KITCHENA fully integrated kitchen with gas hob, oven, dishwasher, washing machine, fridge and freezer. We also have an air fryer, microwave, toaster, kettle etc. You will have your own separate pantry cupboard and there are additional mutual storage cupboards. We share all crockery/cutlery/pots/pans, and split the cost of oil, salt/pepper, cleaning supplies etc.Though we don’t have a separate living room, there is a couch in the kitchen where we often hang out.GARDENWe are very lucky to have a massive garden, shared with the neighbours, with three separate washing lines, a BBQ, veggie patches for each house, and several picnic tables and chairs. Amelia also has an inflatable pool that we made good use of in the summer! Our neighbours maintain the garden but anyone can access the lawnmower etc too.THE AREABecause we’re on a side street off another side street, it’s surprisingly quiet for a bustling area, with Peckham road just a minute away.We are perfectly situated between Camberwell and Peckham’s high streets, with South London Gallery at the end of the street and Toad Bakery and The Peckham Pelican only two blocks away. We have a Sainsbury’s Local across from Toad and of course a wider selection of supermarkets in Camberwell and Peckham.There are excellent bus connections to central and south London, as well as to local tubes - Oval (Northern line), Elephant and Castle (Northern/Bakerloo), and Vauxhall (Victoria) are the closest by bus. Peckham Rye train station is a 15 minute walk from the house, where you can access overground and national rail services.FLATMATESYou will be living with three lovely flatmates - Amelia, Monique, and Felix. While we do our own thing and have busy lives, I’ve always felt welcome to join in - both together with them and also with my flatmates’ friends dinners, cinema trips etc. Amelia and I even went travelling together earlier this year! It’s been a really lovely, honest, down to earth household, and I’ll be sad to leave!Amelia is Canadian and has lived in the U. K. for a few years. She is a SEND teacher locally, working Monday - Friday. She loves to make art, play badminton, and cosy up with….….her 1.5 year old tuxedo cat named George! He is a rascal but pretty adorable (especially when tired!). He is very much part of the household so please don’t apply if you don’t like/are allergic to cats!Monique and Felix are both from Cornwall but have lived in London for a few years. Monique is a SEND teaching assistant and Felix is a gardener at Kew. They both work Monday-Friday. When they’re not cooking up something *delicious*, they’re often out at gigs or the cinema.RENTThe rent is £725/month and bills are shared between us (approximately £110 a month).YOUWe are looking for a long-term tenant who is friendly, respectful, and responsible.

The house is in Whitechapel, very close to the well-connected Whitechapel Station, putting you in the city centre in under 15 minutes. Everything you might need — supermarkets, bars, restaurants — is just around the corner.The sublet is in a townhouse shared with six other people. The house has four floors, and my room is the only one on the ground floor. The flatmates are students and young professionals, mostly in their late twenties. It is an international and friendly household. We get along well; people occasionally spend time together, but everyone is usually busy studying or working, so the house stays calm. Because we all have different schedules, it never feels crowded.There are two full bathrooms (one located on the ground floor) plus an additional toilet. The shared spaces include a large kitchen, a small common room, and a small patio.We are looking for a friendly, calm, and sociable person — ideally a student or young professional in their twenties or early thirties — who needs a short-term place for exactly one month. The room is also suitable for someone spending the holiday period in London. I will be away during the holidays, and several flatmates will also be gone for shorter periods, so at times only two to four people will be in the house.If you are interested, feel free to contact me, even if you need the room for a shorter stay.

ALL BILLS INCLUDED for £2600 per month or £800 per week.Looking for an individual or a couple that would look after the space well. Initial 2-3 months, with rolling over monthly thereafter would be ideal.  Open to weekly or alternative timeframes, possibly longer. Would suit a professional in London, NHS worker or someone looking for a base between apartments. The Let time can be flexible and customised.Key Locations: 1 stop to Bank on DLR or 20 minute walk to Liverpool Street/Bank. 15-minutes to Canary Wharf (3 stops) and 20 minute walk or 1 stop to Shoreditch on Overground line. 10-minute walk to Royal London Hospital.The apartment is my home so it has all the homely touches you would expect!The Living room boasts a fantastic 65inch OLED TV with great sound system. A smart TV able to log in to all your favourite streaming services and have those great movie nights in. Superfast internet and a lovely view from the juliet balcony of the local church and the gardens below. It lets in a lot of natural light and amazing to open up and let in the breeze. There is also an air filter which keeps the apartment fresh and a number of plants!There is a big table/workspace where you can plug your laptop in with a very comfy chair. A great place in case you work from home, with lots of storage.The kitchen comes fully equipped and will have all the essentials you will need to cook up a storm. Wine cooler, dishwasher and washing machine/dryer. Pots and pans etc.The lighting in the apartment is all philips hue smart lights.

There is also a charging port for shavers.The bedroom has a Super King Bed with extremely comfortable mattress. Bookshelf with some reads I am trying to get through as well as a small selection of DVDs. A full wardrobe for hanging your clothes and storing shoes, as well as a big chest of drawers. There is also an ironing board and iron. For those of you looking to bring your fluffy friends, there are bowls under the sink for their water and food as well as a number of toys. There is also an air conditioning unit, which is perhaps not so useful now unless you use the dehumidify mode.The bedroom now has Venetian blinds (not shown in images), which is great for privacy with this top floor apartment. It is also on the side of the apartment with the road so you have to be okay with people driving by in the night and maybe slight noise from any locals walking by. It is central London after all!

Sunny even in the darker months. The private terrace and two balconies are bigger than the internal space - brilliant for weekend and evening al-fresco dining and drinks sun loungers at weekends.Please note - I don't mind if a small group of friends come over on occasion at weekend but not keen on guests spending the night.I've been fortunate enough to let my second bedroom to a succession of flatmates over the last 9 years from all over the world: Australia, Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Scotland, Hong Kong, Italy, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Germany. I'm flexible on terms, so short term agreements are OK.The spare room comes with a brand new double bed with new mattress and enough storage underneath the mattress to fit 10 x carry-on luggage bags.  Additional built-in cupboard storage, a desk supported by two drawers and chair with bed side lamp. All of which can be rearranged or removed entirely, as you wish.  The desk is useful to work from as of course many are now WFH, as I am.The development itself is called Riverside West on Smugglers Way directly above the large Virgin Active gym with 25 meter swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam/sauna, etc. Membership of the gym is not included in the rent, and peak hours are circa £120/month.  There is also underground parking which is also at additional cost.There is a Marks and Spencer's, 3 Sainsbury's, a Tesco’s and various other restaurants/convenience stores within the development or just across the road. Its a 3 minute stroll to the Ship pub on the river - quite famous for the area. There's a 5 min walk to Wandsworth Town Station. 3 stops to Vauxhall Station (Victoria Line) and 4 to Waterloo. Busses also serve the area for all directions across London.The Thames Path is directly opposite the apartment with cycling and running path following the Thames towards Battersea Park and beyond to Central London to the East and Putney/Barnes/Richmond to the West.Open plan kitchen. 52 inch TV, broadband, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Paramount+ all included. Storage in the hallway, dishwasher, washing machine, microwave, oven, grill, large fridge/freezer.  ALL BILLS INCLUDED.My preference is to live with a female as, from experience, I prefer the balance of having one guy, one girl in the apartment.*PARKING* as mentioned above, there is off street, secure parking underneath the development which can either be paid for by the hour (short term) or long/medium term. Approx. prices range from £6/day - £7.5/day depending on how many months are taken. Operators Ts & Cs on request.PS - video was taken several years ago during that crazy hot summer.  I have since updated the living room, fitting a large white bookshelf where the TV also rests.  Much nicer now.

Official move in Jan 1st but you're welcome to move in from December 18th.The Flat:  It’s a modern flat across two floors: bedrooms on the ground floor and communal spaces including a patio in the basement. Two bathrooms including showers. The communal space is open plan and spacious; large living room area with a couple of sofas, dining area and kitchen with lots of storage and the usual appliances you’d expect. The flat is low maintenance - we keep it clean as we go and it all works pretty smoothly. It’s well insulated and pretty easy to heat up in the winter. Bills are not included in the rent and come to approximately £180-200pmThe Room:  Good size space, comes with a double bed, desk, built in wardrobe and has an en-suite shower (no toilet but there’s 2 in the flat). It’s at the rear of the house overlooking the garden, has plenty of privacy and gets the evening sunshine. The interior wall is on the thinner side but we’re a quiet house so it’s never been a problem.The Area:  We’re on a quiet road only a 10-15 min walk from Hackney Central, Hackney Downs & Clapton stations, and very close to lots of bus routes. Lots of shops (Tesco Express, Sainsbury’s Local and Tesco superstore within 5-15min walk), great pubs (too many to name), restaurants, and cafes nearby. Hackney Downs park is just round the corner plus the canals and marshes are a short walk away. We all cycle and there’s plenty of room to keep your bike in the flat if you do too  .Your Flatmates: You’ll be living with two guys, one Brit (36) and one Kiwi (28) who have been living in the area for a couple of years. They both have professional jobs 9-5 and WFH 2-3 days per week. They both have our own things going on but also enjoy watching the football together (both Liverpool fans), going to gigs, festivals, pubs, markets, museums, eating out, etc. They like to have friends over for gatherings and dinners from time to time.

Currently, the house has two professional males and a female in their 30s/40s living there.We're looking to fill the room with a professional who is tidy, non-smoking, considerate, friendly, etc. The lease agreement is very flexible, requiring only a minimum 6-week notice period. The housemates all tend to lead busy, demanding personal and professional work lives; therefore, someone who is already familiar with London and does not mind that the house is not a party house would be best suited. Given that the house does not have a cleaner, it is also important that the person moving in is willing to share in helping ensure that the house is kept clean.The rent is £850 per month, including all bills (i. e., water, TV licence, council tax, gas, electricity, and internet access). The room comes fully furnished, including a wardrobe, mirror, large desk, double bed, and mattress. The room is available from 17 January 2026. There is the possibility that the room might be available earlier in January. The house is compliant with all latest landlord requirements - gas safe, electrical safe, fire safety requirements, etc. All these documents will be shared with the prospective housemate before moving in.The house is located a few minutes' walk away from a large shopping centre, which has all the major high street shops. The address of the house is Wisteria Road, Lewisham, SE13 5HN, which is within Zone 2.The house is approximately a 5-10 minute walk to Lewisham station and a 15-20 minute walk to Blackheath. The trains from Lewisham take about 10 minutes to London Bridge, 14 minutes to Waterloo East, 15 minutes to Charing Cross, and 20 minutes to Victoria station, as well as trains to various other locations in London and throughout the UK. Lewisham is also at the end of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and in Zone 2.

Less than 15mn walk from both Homerton and Clapton stations, plus several bus lines.The private garden at the rear is very peaceful. A lovely rustic bathroom with a bathtub. The living room with a wood-burning stove couldn’t be cosier. Your bedroom faces the park and is twice as large as shown in the picture (uploads limited - can send in private - there’s also a large chest of drawers, a clothes railing and plenty more room to add a desk). A spare desk on the landing is available to share and also faces the park. More room for personal storage outside the bedroom (one tall wardrobe on the landing, 3 oversized drawers under the living room reading bench and a basement).Finally, a French/English housemate in her late thirties. Used to live with women, men and non-binary. Very active: studying for an MA in psychoanalytic studies, professional masseuse (never from home!), and spends a lot of time writing. Too many hobbies to be listed here, but the main ones include going to see exhibitions, shows, films, and gigs, a rave now and then, reflecting upon all this, as well as literature, poetry, and, of course, travelling.  I’m genuine and instinctively social and optimistic, while being calm, healthy and laid back. I'm an outgoing introvert and am proud of my equilibrium between time spent with friends and in my own company. I’m kind, open, personable, and a good communicator.I’ve been in awe of this house since the day I first entered it. And there's no doubt you will as well, as everyone seems to be.

With the window open for circulation, food smells don’t linger.Great size sink, built-in washing machineMini fridge with tiny freezer (there is under counter space for second freezer unit if needed).Microwave not provided but can be considered if needed. A lot of people bring their own appliances, and then I've got nowhere to store unwanted items from the lodger room.Electric kettle and basic crockery provided, one small pot and streamer pot provided. You'll need to bring your own pots and pans if needing more then what's provided.EN-SUITE BATHROOMCompact en-suite bathroom with rain shower, loo, wall cabinet, shelve, hooksLODGER ROOMDesk & chair, wall and floor laundry racks, 2x Ikea wall-pocket shoe storage.Above-the-door storage for 2–3 very large suitcases.Bolt lock on door for privacy when in the room.Loft bed has 135cm wide mattress. There's 183cm clearance underneath to stand up straight!Not everyone loves a high sleeper; a regular bed can be added or setup re-arranged if preferred.No bedding included (can borrow pillows, duvets, covers and sheets if needed short-term for a small fee).Room always warmly heated in winter — it’s the warmest room in the property.LOCATION7-min walk to East Finchley tube Northern line.1 min walk to High Street.Small garden accessible occasionally via shared lounge/bedroom/playroom by prior agreement (e. g., for drying large laundry).SHORT STAYS- RE-ADVERTISING FEE EXPLAINEDBecause I don’t lock people into strict year-long contracts, it offers you the flexibility of a shorter stay — six months is preferred, but as little as two/three months can be agreed — without the commitment of a full year.The re-advertising fee (already part of listed deposit) is essentially the cost of that flexibility- finding new lodgers more often is both costly and time-consuming. I’m flexible on when you leave, except notice period cannot run during December and August please, July may be ok, more below.The £125 re-advertising fee applies to stays of 12 months or less and is fully refunded if you stay 13 months or more.---NOTICE PERIODOne full CALENDAR month’s notice is required i. e. You give notice latest at end of one month then the notice period runs from the 1st to the 31st of the following month.I ask notice period is not to run during the following months due to busy school holidays and potential travel plans thus my unavailability to arrange viewings to replace you: December, July & August.Your understanding and planning to avoid these months is greatly appreciated, and this will be part of the lodger agreement.NOTESA short-term lodger may potentially stay in our adjacent bedroom on occasion — this has never happened before and likely won’t; mentioned for transparency — it would have no impact on your privacy in the self contained lodger room.3 BASIC HOUSE RULES1- Please remove outside shoes either just outside the front door or as you enter to help keep the hall clean.2-Close the front door gently — a soft click is enough; no need to slam or push hard.3- There's no curfew — come and go as you please. Just kindly keep noise to a minimum at all times.Partial Council Tax Band D included.Any questions welcome, feel free to message me.",No,,Furnished,No,No,No preference,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067055.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067050.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067054.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067305.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067296.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067311.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/06/91067053.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/57/91577163.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/91/57/91577167.jpg""]",skiing,English,,No,East Finchley,60,1 month,20,1 month,,1,,Available to all,,No,No,N2Area,Flat share,Yes,"£1,150 pcm",double En suite,,,No,No,East Finchley Station,5-10 minutes walk away,2,,

Please note that the room comes unfurnished so you would need to bring your own bed, etc.The flat is in a 19th Century house with a shared garden & allocated off street parking, minutes from Sydenham overground station/high street with Sainsbury's, shops, cafes, pubs, restaurants etc & very near to Crystal Palace Park.  From Sydenham trains run to Canada Water and London Bridge in just 15 minutes.  The flat has a spacious lounge-dining room, modern kitchen, large bathroom (with bath & power shower), generous hallway and three bedrooms.You'd be sharing the flat with 2 professional people who appreciate a quiet, calm environment.  We share interests in psychology, films, science, books, nature, and sustainable living.  We’re into relaxing in the evenings, very occasionally share a meal & glass of wine, and enjoy a chat now & then.  :)The flat is clean, tidy, and we are quiet, responsible, aware, and considerate - we can only consider living with someone who genuinely knows how to live in this way.   Ideally a new tenant wouldn't work solely from home.  Our landlord is helpful and lives close by.  There’s a flat cleaning rota and shared tenancy agreement via an agency which requires 3 months minimum employment, UK passport, references, and proof of min £20k salary.  Bills are currently approx £160-180 per month on top.  We're in council tax band D (Bromley).   As the flat was entirely unfurnished when we moved in and everything had to be bought at low cost there is a flat furniture deposit which works out at £150 each.Happy to answer any questions, so if you think this may be what you’re looking for, get in touch and include a note about yourself re. your interests/work hours/lifestyle/etc.",No,,Furnished,No,Yes,Females preferred,"[""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98265392.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98265418.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/98/26/98265420.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/94/24/94245453.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/94/24/94245456.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/94/24/94245458.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/94/24/94245460.jpg"", ""https://photos2.spareroom.co.uk/images/flatshare/listings/large/94/24/94245449.jpg""]","music, cooking, reading, art, films, theatre, dancing, swimming, netflix, pubs, gardening, nature, gigs, politics, board games",English,,shared,London SE26,47,None,32,12 months,British,2,,Not suitable for students,LGBT household,Yes,No,SE26Area,Flat share,Yes,£475 pcm,double,,,No,No,Sydenham Station,5-10 minutes walk away,3,,
